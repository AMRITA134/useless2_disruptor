#  FIT / QUITüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: DISRUPTOR


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Amrita Jyothi - AISAT
- Member 2: Theres Manuela - AISAT


### Project Description
**Fit/Quit** is where fashion meets roast mode. Upload your photo, choose a wild outfit, and discover whether you *fit* the look‚Äîor should just *quit* trying. It‚Äôs brutally honest, hilariously savage, and dangerously fun.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people walk into parties thinking they look hot, when in reality... they're dressed like confused garden gnomes.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Fit/Quit bravely tackles this global crisis by delivering savage outfit roasts before the public suffers.
